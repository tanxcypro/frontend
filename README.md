# Typechecking with Prop Types

As your app grows, you can catch a lot of bugs with typechecking. React has some built-in typechecking abilities.  
To run typechecking on the props for a component, you can assign the special propTypes property and combine them with prop-types library to specify what type the value will received by props.
